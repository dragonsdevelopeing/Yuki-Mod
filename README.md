Yuki Mod

This is a NONEAC safe mod. Turn off EAC when playing this mod.
This is a mod of Valmod, Compo Pack, and a couple other bits from other mods. As well as my own additions and tweeks.
It is a WIP and being balanced as i go. So expect it to change over time. 
Also New weapon skins/looks will b being added as soon as SDX editor is updated.
Skills and perks have been doubled in limit. As well as player max level has been increased.
Longer and more quests will be added.
Loot.xml needs the new weapons placed in them. Atm they are craftable but not loot drops.
This Version is for testing on SP and with cheat menu ON.
